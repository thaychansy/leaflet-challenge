<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

### Objective
Develop an effective visualization tool to represent earthquake data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). This tool should help the USGS display and interpret their extensive earthquake data in a meaningful way.

### GitHub Pages Live Link:

### Background
The USGS is responsible for delivering crucial scientific information on natural hazards, ecosystem health, environmental conditions, and the impacts of climate and land-use changes. They collect and analyze vast amounts of earthquake data from around the world on a daily basis but currently lack a sophisticated method for visualizing this data. A well-designed visualization tool will enhance public understanding, facilitate communication with other government agencies, and potentially assist in securing additional funding for their initiatives.

### Instructions
1. Understand the Data:

- Review the earthquake data provided by the USGS.
- Familiarize with the key attributes of the data, such as magnitude, depth, and location of earthquakes.

2. Design the Visualization:

- Create a visualization that clearly represents earthquake data in terms of magnitude and depth.
- Incorporate features that allow users to interact with and explore the data, such as filtering by magnitude or depth, zooming into specific regions, and viewing detailed information about individual earthquakes.

3. Develop the Visualization:

- Implement the visualization using appropriate tools and technologies (e.g., JavaScript libraries like Leaflet.js and D3.js).
- Ensure that the visualization is user-friendly, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing.

4. Enhance Usability:

- Add functionalities like legends improve the user experience.
- Ensure that the visualization is accessible and provides clear insights into the data.

### Goal
Create a robust earthquake visualization tool that will aid the USGS in educating the public and other government organizations about earthquake activity, thus supporting their mission and potentially enhancing their funding opportunities.

<!-- BUILT -->


## Built with Leaflet HTML JavaScript and CSS Framework 

1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

- Role: Provides the basic structure and content of the web application. HTML is used to create the elements of the webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, and containers, forming the skeleton of the application.

2. JavaScript:

- Role: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web application. JavaScript is used to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), handle user inputs, fetch data from APIs, and update the content and appearance of the webpage in real time.

3. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

- Role: Styles and formats the visual presentation of the web application. CSS is responsible for the layout, colors, fonts, and overall design of the webpage, ensuring that the application is visually appealing and user-friendly.

4. Leaflet Framework:

- Role: Provides tools for creating interactive maps. Leaflet is a lightweight JavaScript library designed for embedding and manipulating maps on the web. It offers functionalities such as zooming, panning, and layering, making it ideal for displaying geospatial data like earthquake information.

Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!

1. Fork the Project

2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b new-branch-name`)

3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some message'`)

4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin new-branch-name`)

5. Create a pull request. 

Forking a repository and creating a pull request on GitHub is a great way to contribute to open-source projects. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Forking the Repository:

Find the repository you want to contribute to on GitHub.
Click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner. This creates a copy of the repository in your own account.

2. Clone the Forked Repository to Your Local Machine

You'll need Git installed on your system.
Use Git commands to clone your forked repository to your local machine. There will be instructions on the GitHub repository page for cloning.

3. Making Changes (Local Work):

Make your changes to the code in your local copy.
Use Git commands to track your changes (adding, committing).

4. Pushing Changes to Your Fork:

Once you're happy with your changes, use Git commands to push your local commits to your forked repository on GitHub.

5. Creating a Pull Request:

Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
Click the "Compare & pull request" button (might appear as a yellow banner).
Here, you'll see a comparison between your changes and the original repository.
Write a clear title and description for your pull request explaining the changes you made.
Click "Create Pull Request" to submit it for review.
